```

## Advanced Algorithms

```
Dynamic
    - Overlapping Sub Problem
    - Memoization
    - Tabulation
Greedy
    - Concepts & Examples
Others
    - Backtracking
    - Shortest Path
    - Minimum Spanning Tree

```

## Recursion (Also searching & sorting using recursion)

---

# Leetcode

## How To Use 'LeetCode' For Practise

```
- Go to Problems section
- Choose the topic to practise
- Sort by Difficulty
- Start solving easy -> medium -> hard questions
- Note: solving question with higher thumbs-up
- Solve at least 2 questions everyday (1 easy, 1 medium)
```

## How To Solve A Given Problem

```
- Step 1: Read the problem question very carefully
- Step 2: Think and create solution OR algorithm on paper (DryRun)
- Step 3: Unable to understand ?
  * Look at the Solution Section or YT videos
  * Understand the solution & Create your own solution on paper.
- Step 4: Code the solution.
```
